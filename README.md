# Weather App

**Demo: https://patrickhuizinga88.github.io/weather-app/**

My first public project in Vue.

With this weather app you can find the weather of any location in the world. I used the WeatherAPI to make this possible. To check the weather in the location of your interest, simply type it into the input and press enter. Then select the location you wish for. The search results are based on city name, region, country and also distance from the most relevant search result.

I have made this app by myself with the help of Google search. I got the designs from dribbble.com .
